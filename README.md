# 🔐 Network Infrastructure Simulation with Security Controls

This project simulates a complete enterprise network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It includes subnetting, VLAN configuration, ACLs, firewall zones, VPN setup, AAA (TACACS+/RADIUS), Syslog, and NTP integration.  

The network is segmented into multiple /28 and /30 networks with strict security policies and routing enabled via OSPF.

## ✅ Features
- 🔹 VLAN segmentation with port-security
- 🔹 WAN communication using /30 subnets
- 🔹 Zone-Based Policy Firewall configuration
- 🔹 Site-to-Site IPSec VPN setup
- 🔹 AAA: Local + TACACS+ & RADIUS authentication
- 🔹 ACLs for traffic control and threat mitigation
- 🔹 Syslog and NTP server integration
- 🔹 Complete addressing plan and network documentation

> 📘 Ideal for students and cybersecurity learners aiming to gain hands-on Cisco security lab experience.
